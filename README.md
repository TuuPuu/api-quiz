# API Coding Quiz

## Description

A fun quiz for useres to test  their Frontend Dev knowledge :D

I wanted to create an interactive and educational coding quiz game to offer a unique and entertaining way for users to reinforce their coding knowledge through a quiz format.
During the development of this project, I gained insights into creating interactive web applications using a combination HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, as well as beginning to understand how the three interact in dynamic pages.
